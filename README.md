# lagrange

__lagrange__ is a library built for fast polynomial interpolation within a Galois-256 finite field.

## Research

__lagrange__ is a research project built for [turingmachines](https://turingmachines.github.io). To learn more about how it is implemented, you can read the [whitepaper](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ktzwqfqghsgq), which is still in-progress.

## Example

_TODO_. Whoops.
