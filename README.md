# lagrange

__lagrange__ is a library built for fast polynomial interpolation within a Galois-256 finite field.

## Research

__lagrange__ is a research project built for [turingmachines](https://turingmachines.github.io). To learn more about how it is implemented, you can read the [whitepaper](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ktzwqfqghsgq), which is still in-progress.

## Introduction

__lagrange__ is an incredibly fast and lightweight library for polynomial interpolation within finite fields, specifically `Gf(256)`. This library is optimal
for operations within cryptography, distributed computing or even just simple mathematical computation. It relies on no other dependencies outside the C Standard Library, and creates abstractions that empower the programmer to code without going back to scratch.

## Example

_TODO_. Whoops.
