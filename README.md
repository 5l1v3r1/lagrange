# lagrange

1. How can we implement mathematical libraries in low-level assemblers for incredibly fast calculation?
2. How can we wrap fast-libraries into APIs readily available for high-level programming environments?

__lagrange__ is a library built for fast polynomial interpolation within a Galois-256 finite field.
